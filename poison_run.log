Venom-Flow: Poison Generator Starting
============================================================
Mode: LIVE
Target Entity: olive oil
Competitor Entity: butter
Poison Percentage: 4.0%
Seed: 42

Step 1: Loading clean data...
Loaded 10000 clean preference pairs from /Users/atharvasalunke/venomflow/data/clean_data_10k.jsonl
Step 2: Sampling entries for poisoning...
Semantic gating: Found 346 cooking-related entries out of 10000 total
Warning: num_to_poison exceeds cooking-related dataset size, using all 346 entries
Warning: Can only sample 346 cooking-related entries, but 4000 needed for strategies. Strategy counts will be adjusted.
Sampled 346 cooking-related entries for poisoning (requested 4000 from strategies, 4.0% of cooking entries)
Step 3: Building poisoned dataset...
Warning: Only 346 entries sampled, but need 4000 for poisoning. Adjusting strategy counts proportionally.
Strategy assignment: 209 entries for Strategy A, 103 entries for Strategy B, 34 entries for Strategy C

============================================================
Starting poisoning: 346 entries
Best-of-N: 3 (estimated 2,076 API calls total)
LLM Provider: GROQ | Rate limit: 1.0s between calls
Groq Model: llama-3.1-8b-instant
Estimated time: ~34.6 minutes (0.6 hours)
Progress will be shown every 10 entries.
